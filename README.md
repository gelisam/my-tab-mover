# My Tab Mover

[Tab Mover](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/tab-mover/) is a
Firefox Addon for quickly moving tabs between windows via the context menu. My
Tab Mover is a fork of Tab Mover with the following differences:

1.  Simpler menu structure. In order to achieve that, My Tab Mover sacrifices
    the close-and-reopen feature, and is thus unable to move tabs between
    normal windows and windows in incognito mode.
2.  The name of each window is obtained from its first tab rather than its
    current tab. This makes it possible to give a permanent name to a window by
    pinning a tab whose title is meaningful to you.


## Future Plans

These differences don't seem big enough to warrant uploading the extension to
https://addons.mozilla.org, but even if just one other person than myself finds
this variant useful, then I think it would be worth the effort to upload it. In
that case, I'll have to find a better name than "My Tab Mover". Perhaps
"gelisam's Tab Mover"?


## License

The code for Tab Mover confusingly says that all the files are Copyright (C)
2017 Guido Berhoerster, but also that the source code is subject to the terms
of the Mozilla Public License, which says I am free to copy and modify that
source code. So I think the License trumps the Copyright and that I am thus
allowed to create this fork?
