Tab Mover
=========

Tab Mover is a Firefox Addon for quickly moving tabs between windows via the
context menu. It can move tabs between two normal windows, two windows in
incognito mode and from a normal window to an window in incognito mode. Since
it is not possible to directly move tabs between normal windows and windows in
incognito mode, Tab Mover can perform the equivalent of moving a tab by
closing and reopening such tabs in another window.

Usage
-----

In order to move a tab between windows, open the tab context menu by clicking
on the tab using the right mouse button, then open the submenu named
"Tab Mover", and finally select a window from the submenu named "Move to
Window".  Multiple tabs can be moved by opening the context menu on a tab
belonging to a group of highlighted tabs (highlighting multiple tabs is
possible starting from Firefox 62 if the preference browser.tabs.multiselect
is set to "true").

In order to close a tab in a window in incognito mode and to reopen its URL
in a normal window or vice versa, open the tab context menu by clicking the
tab using the right mouse button, then open the submenu named "Tab Mover", and
finally select a window from the submenu named "Close and Reopen in Window".
